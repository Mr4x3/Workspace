going down for real
going down for real

Your girl just kissed girl
chicks
Shake for shake
throwing these Emirates the sky
Spinning this salamu alaykum
Peace
love beaches south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
could just roll
Cause swoll
that birthday cake get cobra
Buggati for real cold bruh
That auto biography rover
Got the key city over
thots only Anna Kournikova
said rackets ratchets hold
said rackets ratchets hold

know what you came here see
you freak then coming home with
And know what you came here
Now bust open let see you get low
going down for real
going down for real
And they already know
going down for real

going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah girl you never seen her
Cause tints limousines
touch the Midas
plus your man minus
team blowing that slam
Make you cough cough that Bronchitis
Put your hands
stick more makeup
Get that ass the floor
Ladies put your lipstick
Double entendre double entendre
While you hating get money
Then double tonkers

know what you came here see
you freak then coming home with
And know what you came here
Now bust open let see you get low
going down for real
going down for real
going down for real
going down for real
going down for real

Lift drop shake pop
Lift drop shake pop
Lift drop shake pop
Lift drop shake

going down for real
going down for real
going down for real
going down for real

going down for real
