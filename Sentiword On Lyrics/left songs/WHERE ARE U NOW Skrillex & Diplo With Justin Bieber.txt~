"Where Are Ü Now"
(feat. Justin Bieber)

I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I’m all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying? 
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh Lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you the most

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most (I need you the most, I need you the most)
